## Abstract
I want to see the impact last year during the early months of covid in NYC lead to an increase in crime. I focused on Shooting incidents as they are a more concerning crime for those who live or want to live in NYC. If there is a correlation between the release of inmates and the increase in shooting incidents then actions can be taken to increase civilian safety by retrieving the released inmates that are tied to shooting incidents, gang activities, and any type of violence.
